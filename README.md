# MMTest
This is working build of MMT.
Need to update ProgressBar, Comments for methods
Need to update the infinite scrolling in Collection View
While selecting any of the Collection View Cell Item, It will highlighted with red color and display the detailed view bottem of the screen.
When we want to deselect the Cell Item, We need to tap on Detailed View, So Detailed view will be hidden and already selected Cell item will be deselected.
Implemented basic UI.
